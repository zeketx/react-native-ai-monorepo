# Data Migration Plan: Supabase to Payload CMS

## Overview

This document outlines the complete plan for migrating data from Supabase to Payload CMS, including pre-migration preparation, execution steps, validation procedures, and rollback strategies.

## Migration Goals

- **Zero Data Loss**: Ensure all data is successfully migrated without loss

## Migration Timeline

### Phase 1: Data Export (Est. 2-4 hours)
**Objective**: Export all data from Supabase

**Steps**:
1. **Maintenance Mode** (Optional)
   - Enable maintenance mode if real-time data consistency is critical
   - Display maintenance message to users

2. **Run Export Script**
   ```bash
   npx ts-node scripts/migration/export-supabase.ts
   ```

3. **Verify Export**
   - Check export_summary.json for completeness
   - Verify all expected tables were exported
   - Confirm file sizes are reasonable

**Success Criteria**:
- All tables exported without errors
- Export summary shows expected record counts
- No critical failures in export log

**Rollback**: N/A (read-only operation)

### Phase 2: Data Transformation (Est. 1-2 hours)
**Objective**: Transform Supabase data to Payload format

**Steps**:
1. **Run Transformation Script**
   ```bash
   npx ts-node scripts/migration/transform-data.ts
   ```

2. **Review Transformation Results**
   - Check transformation_summary.json
   - Validate sample records manually
   - Confirm relationship mappings

**Success Criteria**:
- All collections transformed successfully
- Record counts match between original and transformed data
- Sample validation passes

**Rollback**: Re-run transformation with corrected mapping

### Phase 3: Data Import (Est. 3-6 hours)
**Objective**: Import transformed data into Payload CMS

**Steps**:
1. **Dry Run Import**
   ```bash
   DRY_RUN=true npx ts-node scripts/migration/import-payload.ts
   ```

2. **Review Dry Run Results**
   - Verify expected import counts
   - Check for any validation errors
   - Confirm collection dependencies

3. **Live Import**
   ```bash
   npx ts-node scripts/migration/import-payload.ts
   ```

4. **Monitor Import Progress**
   - Watch for memory usage
   - Check for import errors
   - Verify batch processing

**Success Criteria**:
- All collections imported successfully
- Import summary shows expected success rates
- No critical import failures

**Rollback**: Clear Payload database and restore from backup

### Phase 4: Data Validation (Est. 1-2 hours)
**Objective**: Verify migration success and data integrity

**Steps**:
1. **Run Validation Script**
   ```bash
   npx ts-node scripts/migration/validate-migration.ts
   ```

2. **Manual Spot Checks**
   - Test user authentication
   - Verify trip data completeness
   - Check file uploads and media
   - Validate relationships

3. **Application Testing**
   - Test core user flows
   - Verify API responses
   - Check mobile app functionality

**Success Criteria**:
- Validation script passes all checks
- Manual testing confirms functionality
- No data integrity issues found

**Rollback**: If validation fails, execute rollback procedure

### Phase 5: Go-Live (Est. 1 hour)
**Objective**: Switch production traffic to Payload CMS

**Steps**:
1. **Update Application Configuration**
   - Switch API endpoints to Payload
   - Update environment variables
   - Deploy application updates

2. **User Communication**
   - Send password reset emails to all users
   - Notify users of any changes
   - Update documentation

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor error rates
   - Watch performance metrics
   - Check user feedback channels

**Success Criteria**:
- Application runs without errors
- Users can authenticate and access data
- Performance meets expectations

**Rollback**: Revert to Supabase configuration

## Rollback Strategy

### Quick Rollback (< 30 minutes)
**Scenario**: Application issues or critical bugs discovered immediately after go-live

**Steps**:
1. Revert application configuration to use Supabase
2. Restore previous environment variables
3. Redeploy application
4. Verify functionality
5. Communicate with users

### Data Rollback (1-3 hours)
**Scenario**: Data integrity issues discovered, need to restore Payload database

**Steps**:
1. Take Payload CMS offline
2. Restore Payload database from pre-migration backup
3. Verify restoration success
4. Run validation checks
5. Resume service

### Full Rollback (2-4 hours)
**Scenario**: Critical issues requiring complete reversion

**Steps**:
1. Take all services offline
2. Restore Payload database from backup
3. Revert all application code changes
4. Restore Supabase configuration
5. Verify complete functionality
6. Communicate with stakeholders

### Rollback Decision Matrix

| Issue Type | Severity | Recommended Action | Timeline |
|------------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Application bugs | High | Quick Rollback | < 30min |
| Authentication issues | Critical | Quick Rollback | < 15min |
| Data inconsistency | High | Data Rollback | 1-2hrs |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Monitor/Quick Rollback | 30-60min |
| Missing data | Critical | Data Rollback | 1-3hrs |
| Widespread user issues | Critical | Full Rollback | 2-4hrs |

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **User Authentication**
   - **Risk**: Users unable to log in after migration
   - **Mitigation**: Password reset flow, communication plan
   - **Rollback**: Quick config rollback

2. **File Storage Migration**
   - **Risk**: Media files not accessible after migration
   - **Mitigation**: Parallel storage setup, URL rewriting
   - **Rollback**: Revert to original storage URLs

3. **Relationship Data**
   - **Risk**: Foreign key relationships broken
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive validation scripts, relationship checks
   - **Rollback**: Data rollback with relationship verification

4. **Performance**
   - **Risk**: Payload CMS slower than Supabase
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing, caching strategy
   - **Rollback**: Quick config rollback

### Medium-Risk Areas

1. **Data Transformation Errors**
   - **Risk**: Data corrupted during transformation
   - **Mitigation**: Validation scripts, sample checks
   - **Rollback**: Re-run transformation with fixes

2. **Schema Mismatches**
   - **Risk**: Payload schema doesn't match expectations
   - **Mitigation**: Schema validation, test imports
   - **Rollback**: Schema updates and re-import

## Monitoring and Alerting
