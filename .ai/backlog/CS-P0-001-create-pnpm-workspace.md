# Task: Create PNPM Workspace Configuration

**ID:** CS-P0-001  
**Phase:** Foundation  
**Dependencies:** None

## Objective
Set up PNPM workspace configuration to transform the current single React Native app into a monorepo structure that will support multiple packages (mobile app, web dashboard, and shared utilities).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file exists in project root
- [ ] Workspace configuration correctly defines packages directory
- [ ] PNPM can recognize the workspace structure
- [ ] Running `pnpm ls -r --depth 0` shows the workspace configuration

## Implementation Notes
1. Create `pnpm-workspace.yaml` in the project root with the following content:
   ```yaml
   packages:
     - 'packages/*'
   ```

2. This configuration tells PNPM to treat all directories under `packages/` as workspace packages

3. Verify PNPM version is 8.0.0 or higher:
   ```bash
   pnpm --version
   ```

## Testing
- Run `pnpm install` from root - should complete without errors
- Run `pnpm ls -r --depth 0` - should show workspace structure (even if empty initially)

## Estimated Effort
1 hour
