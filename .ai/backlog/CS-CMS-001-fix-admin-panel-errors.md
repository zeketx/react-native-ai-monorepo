# CS-CMS-001: Fix CMS Admin Panel Critical Errors

## Priority
High

## Estimated Effort
3-4 hours

## Overview
The Payload CMS admin panel is currently returning 500 errors and cannot be accessed due to critical React server component errors.

## Background
- CMS server starts successfully on port 3000
- Database connection appears to be working (schema pulled successfully)
- Admin panel at `/admin` returns 500 Internal Server Error
- Core functionality is broken preventing CMS usage

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. ServerFunctionsProvider Error
**Error**: `ServerFunctionsProvider requires a serverFunction prop`
**Location**: `../src/elements/EditUpload/index.tsx (337:1)`
**Impact**: Complete admin panel failure

### 2. React Rendering Stack Errors
- Multiple renderNode failures in Next.js React stack
- Component tree failing to render properly
- Suggests configuration or compatibility issue

## Root Cause Analysis Needed

### Potential Causes
1. **Next.js/React Version Compatibility**: 
   - Using Next.js 15.0.3 with React 19.0.0
   - Payload CMS may have compatibility issues with React 19

2. **Payload CMS Configuration Issues**:
   - Missing required server function configuration
   - Incorrect Next.js app router setup

3. **Dependencies Mismatch**:
   - Check if all Payload CMS dependencies are compatible
   - Version conflicts between UI components and core

## Requirements

### Immediate Fixes
1. Resolve ServerFunctionsProvider error
2. Fix React rendering stack failures
3. Ensure admin panel loads successfully
4. Verify basic CRUD operations work

### Configuration Review
1. Review `payload.config.ts` for missing configurations
2. Check Next.js app router setup in `packages/cms/src/app`
3. Validate all required Payload CMS dependencies

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Admin panel loads at `/admin`
- [ ] Can create/read/update/delete users
- [ ] Collections are accessible
- [ ] File uploads work (if configured)
- [ ] No console errors in browser

## Technical Implementation

### Investigation Steps
1. Check Payload CMS documentation for React 19 compatibility
2. Review ServerFunctionsProvider requirements
3. Compare working Payload CMS setups with similar stack

### Potential Solutions
1. **Downgrade React**: Consider React 18 if Payload CMS doesn't support React 19
2. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all @payloadcms packages are latest compatible versions
3. **Configuration Fix**: Add missing serverFunction prop or configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CMS admin panel loads without errors
2. All collections are accessible and functional
3. Basic CRUD operations work for Users collection
4. No critical console errors
5. 500 errors resolved

## Dependencies
- Need access to Payload CMS documentation
- May require dependency version changes
- Could impact other CMS-dependent features

## Notes
- This is blocking CMS functionality entirely
- Should be prioritized before any CMS-dependent features
- May require coordination with any authentication integration

## Related Tasks
- CS-WEB-003: Enable static data testing (completed - provides fallback)
- Future tasks depending on CMS functionality should wait for this fix
