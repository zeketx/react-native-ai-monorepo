# Task: Create Monorepo Package Directory Structure

**ID:** CS-P0-002  
**Phase:** Foundation  
**Dependencies:** CS-P0-001

## Objective
Create the directory structure for the monorepo packages that will house the mobile app, web dashboard, and shared code.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `packages/` directory exists in project root
- [ ] `packages/mobile-app/` directory exists
- [ ] `packages/web-dashboard/` directory exists
- [ ] `packages/shared/` directory exists
- [ ] Directory structure is properly committed to git

## Implementation Notes
1. From project root, create the packages directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p packages/mobile-app
   mkdir -p packages/web-dashboard
   mkdir -p packages/shared
   ```

2. Create placeholder README files to ensure directories are tracked by git:
   ```bash
   echo "# Mobile App Package" > packages/mobile-app/README.md
   echo "# Web Dashboard Package" > packages/web-dashboard/README.md
   echo "# Shared Package" > packages/shared/README.md
   ```

3. Verify structure:
   ```bash
   tree packages/ -L 1
   ```

## Expected Structure
```
packages/
├── mobile-app/
├── web-dashboard/
└── shared/
```
