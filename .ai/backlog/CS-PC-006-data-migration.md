# CS-PC-006: Data Migration Strategy

## Priority
P2 - Important

## Description
Plan and execute migration of existing data from Supabase to Payload CMS, ensuring data integrity and minimal downtime.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Data migration plan documented
- [ ] Export scripts for Supabase data
- [ ] Transform scripts to match Payload schema  
- [ ] Import scripts for Payload CMS
- [ ] Data validation scripts
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Zero data loss verified

## Technical Details

### Migration Steps:
1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Map Supabase tables to Payload collections
   - Identify data transformations needed
   - Plan for relationship migrations

2. **Export Phase**
   - Export users, clients, trips, preferences
   - Export media files and attachments
   - Create backup archives

3. **Transform Phase**
   - Convert Supabase UUIDs to Payload IDs
   - Transform JSON fields to Payload format
   - Update relationship references

4. **Import Phase**
   - Use Payload's Local API for bulk import
   - Maintain referential integrity
   - Verify all relationships

### Scripts to Create:
- `scripts/export-supabase.ts`
- `scripts/transform-data.ts`
- `scripts/import-payload.ts`
- `scripts/validate-migration.ts`

## Dependencies
- CS-PC-002 (Schema must match)
- Access to production Supabase data
- Payload instance ready for import

## Notes
- Run migration in staging first
- Consider phased migration approach
- Keep Supabase as backup for 30 days
