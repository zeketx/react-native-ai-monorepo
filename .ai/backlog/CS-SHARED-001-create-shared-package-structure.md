# CS-SHARED-001: Create Shared Package Structure

## Priority
P0 - Critical Foundation

## Status
PENDING

## Description
Create the missing shared package that was supposed to be implemented in CS-P0-005 through CS-P0-010. This package is critical for sharing types, utilities, and constants between the CMS and mobile app packages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `/packages/shared` directory structure
- [ ] Set up package.json with proper configuration
- [ ] Configure TypeScript with tsconfig.json
- [ ] Set up build process for the shared package
- [ ] Ensure package can be imported by both CMS and mobile-app
- [ ] Add shared package to pnpm workspace configuration

## Technical Details

### Package Structure:
```
packages/shared/
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── types/
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   ├── user.ts
│   │   ├── trip.ts
│   │   ├── client.ts
│   │   └── preferences.ts
│   ├── constants/
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   ├── api.ts
│   │   └── app.ts
│   └── utils/
│       ├── index.ts
│       ├── validation.ts
│       └── formatting.ts
├── dist/           # Build output
└── README.md
```

### Implementation Steps:
1. Create directory structure
2. Initialize package.json with name `@clientsync/shared`
3. Configure TypeScript for library output
4. Set up exports in package.json
5. Update workspace dependencies

## Dependencies
- Monorepo must be properly configured (CS-P0-001)
- TypeScript must be installed

## Notes
- This is a critical missing piece that blocks proper type sharing
- Should have been created with CS-P0-005 but was missed
- Required for proper integration between packages
