# SDLC Workflow Documentation

## Overview
This document defines the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) workflow for the ClientSync platform development.

## Task Management System

### Task Structure
All tasks are managed using markdown files with a standardized format:

```markdown
# [TASK-ID]: [Task Title]

**Phase**: Phase X - [Phase Name]
**Priority**: High/Medium/Low
**Status**: Backlog/Doing/Done
**Estimated Effort**: X-Y hours

## Overview
Brief description of what this task accomplishes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, measurable requirements
- [ ] Clear definition of completion

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: Tasks that must be completed first
- **Blocks**: Tasks that depend on this one

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Criteria that must be met for task completion

## Implementation Notes
Technical details and approach guidance.
```

### Task Lifecycle

#### 1. Backlog → Doing
- Select task from `.ai/backlog/`
- Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/[task-description]`
- Move task file from `backlog/` to `doing/`
- Update task status to "Doing"
- Begin implementation

#### 2. During Development
- Follow implementation notes and acceptance criteria
- Make frequent commits with descriptive messages
- Update task file with progress notes
- Test implementation thoroughly

#### 3. Doing → Done
- Complete all acceptance criteria
- Verify all tests pass
- Update task file with completion notes
- Move task file from `doing/` to `done/`
- Update task status to "Done"
- Merge feature branch to main
- Clean up feature branch

## Phase Organization

### Phase 0: Foundation
**Goal**: Establish core infrastructure and database foundation
- Database schema and migrations
- Authentication infrastructure
- Row Level Security policies
- Helper functions and utilities
- Environment configuration
- Deployment setup

### Phase 1: Authentication & User Management
**Goal**: Implement complete user authentication and profile management
- User registration and login flows
- Profile management
- Role-based access control
- User onboarding process

### Phase 2: Trip Planning & Booking
**Goal**: Core trip planning and booking functionality
- Trip creation and management
- Flight, hotel, and activity selection
- Booking workflow
- Client preferences management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Integrations
**Goal**: Enhanced features and third-party integrations
- Payment processing
- Email notifications
- External API integrations
- Advanced trip customization

### Phase 4: Performance & Optimization
**Goal**: Optimize performance and user experience
- Performance monitoring
- Code optimization
- User experience improvements
- Analytics and reporting

## Branch Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention
- Feature branches: `feature/[brief-description]`
- Bug fixes: `bugfix/[issue-description]`
- Hot fixes: `hotfix/[urgent-fix]`
- Releases: `release/[version-number]`

### Branch Management
1. **Never push directly to main**
2. **Create feature branch for each task or related task group**
3. **Keep feature branches focused and short-lived**
4. **Merge only after testing and review**
5. **Clean up merged branches**

## Commit Standards

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Optional longer description explaining the changes and why they were made.

Closes #issue-number (if applicable)
```

### Commit Types
- `feat`: New feature implementation
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without feature changes
- `test`: Test additions or modifications
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

### Examples
```
feat(auth): implement user registration with allowlist validation

Add user registration flow that validates email against allowlist
and initializes client data using database helper functions.

- Create registration form with validation
- Integrate with Supabase auth service
- Add allowlist checking
- Initialize client profile and preferences
```

## Quality Assurance

### Pre-Commit Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] No console.log or debug statements
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Security best practices followed
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for new functionality
- Integration tests for cross-package features
- Manual testing of user-facing features
- Security testing for authentication and data access

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- JSDoc comments for all public functions
- README files for each package
- API documentation for services
- Configuration examples and templates

### Task Documentation
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Implementation notes and approach
- Dependency mapping
- Post-completion notes and lessons learned

## Tools and Utilities

### Development Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Development server
pnpm -r dev

# Testing
pnpm -r test
pnpm -r lint

# Build
pnpm -r build
```

### Task Management Commands
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/task-description

# Move task to doing
mv .ai/backlog/CS-P0-XXX.md .ai/doing/

# Complete task
mv .ai/doing/CS-P0-XXX.md .ai/done/
```

## Continuous Integration

### Build Pipeline
1. **Dependency Installation**: Install all workspace dependencies
2. **Linting**: Run ESLint across all packages
3. **Type Checking**: Verify TypeScript compilation
4. **Testing**: Execute unit and integration tests
5. **Build**: Create production builds
6. **Security Scan**: Check for vulnerabilities

### Deployment Pipeline
1. **Environment Validation**: Verify configuration
2. **Database Migration**: Apply schema changes
3. **Application Deployment**: Deploy to target environment
4. **Health Checks**: Verify deployment success
5. **Rollback Plan**: Prepare rollback if needed

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Code Quality Metrics
- Test coverage percentage
- Code complexity analysis
- Dependency security audits
- Performance benchmarks

### Task Progress Tracking
- Phase completion percentages
- Task velocity and estimation accuracy
- Dependency bottleneck identification
- Resource allocation optimization

## Best Practices

### Development
1. **Follow the DRY principle**: Don't repeat yourself
2. **Write tests first when possible**: Test-driven development
3. **Keep functions small and focused**: Single responsibility
4. **Use meaningful variable and function names**: Self-documenting code
5. **Handle errors gracefully**: Comprehensive error handling

### Collaboration
1. **Communicate early and often**: Share progress and blockers
2. **Review code thoroughly**: Maintain code quality standards
3. **Document decisions**: Record architectural and design choices
4. **Share knowledge**: Conduct code reviews and knowledge sharing sessions
5. **Respect the workflow**: Follow established processes and conventions
