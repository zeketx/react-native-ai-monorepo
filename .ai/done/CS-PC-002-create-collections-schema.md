## Completion Notes

**Completed on:** December 30, 2024
**Branch:** feature/cs-pc-002-collections-schema

### Implementation Summary
Successfully created comprehensive Payload CMS collections schema:

1. **Users Collection** - Enhanced existing collection with role-based authentication (admin, organizer, client)
2. **Clients Collection** - Complete client management with tier system, emergency contacts, and preference relationships
3. **Trips Collection** - Comprehensive trip management with status tracking, budget, travelers, and itinerary details
4. **Media Collection** - File upload management with access control and categorization
5. **Preference Collections**:
   - **FlightPreferences**: Airlines, seat preferences, meal options, loyalty programs, special requests
   - **HotelPreferences**: Hotel categories, room types, location preferences, amenities
   - **ActivityPreferences**: Activity levels, interests, accessibility requirements, group preferences
   - **DiningPreferences**: Dietary restrictions, cuisine preferences, meal timing, budget ranges

### Key Features Implemented
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admins, organizers, and clients have appropriate permissions
- **Data Validation**: Required fields, enums, and constraints properly configured
- **Collection Hooks**: Business logic for status updates and data integrity
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships between collections

   - email, password, role
   - relationship to Clients
   
2. **Clients**

   - tier (enum: standard, premium, platinum)
   - preferences (relationships)
   - trips (relationship)
   
3. **Trips**
   - title, description, dates
   - status (planning, confirmed, completed)

5. **Media** 
   - Trip photos, documents

## Dependencies
- CS-PC-001 must be completed

## Notes
- Use Payload's built-in auth for Users collection
- Implement field-level access control
- Consider using Payload's localization for multi-language support
