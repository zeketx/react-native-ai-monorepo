# CS-P0-016: Supabase Authentication Integration

**Phase**: Phase 0 - Foundation  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Completed  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours  
**Actual Effort**: 5 hours  
**Completed**: 2025-01-21  

## Overview
Integrate Supabase authentication with the shared package and mobile app to provide seamless user authentication flow with proper role-based access control.

## Background
With the database schema, RLS policies, and helper functions complete, we need to integrate Supabase authentication to enable user registration, login, and role-based access throughout the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Shared Package Authentication Module
- [x] Create `@clientsync/shared/auth` module with TypeScript types
- [x] Implement Supabase client configuration for authentication
- [x] Create authentication service with login/register/logout methods
- [x] Add user session management utilities
- [x] Export authentication types and services

### 2. Authentication Service Features
- [x] Email allowlist validation during registration
- [x] Automatic client data initialization after successful registration
- [x] Role-based user profile creation (client/organizer/admin)
- [x] Session persistence and refresh handling
- [x] Authentication state management

### 3. Mobile App Integration
- [x] Configure Supabase client in mobile app
- [x] Implement authentication screens (login/register)
- [x] Add authentication context provider
- [x] Create protected route components
- [x] Add authentication hooks for components

### 4. Security Implementation
- [x] Implement JWT token handling
- [x] Add secure storage for authentication tokens
- [x] Implement automatic token refresh
- [x] Add authentication error handling
- [x] Validate user permissions using RLS policies

### 5. Testing & Verification
- [x] Unit tests for authentication service
- [x] Integration tests with database functions
- [x] Manual testing of authentication flows
- [x] Verification that RLS policies work with authenticated users
- [x] Test role-based access control

## Technical Implementation

### Shared Package Structure
```
packages/shared/src/
├── auth/
│   ├── index.ts           # Export authentication services
│   ├── types.ts           # Authentication types
│   ├── client.ts          # Supabase client configuration
│   ├── service.ts         # Authentication service methods
│   └── utils.ts           # Authentication utilities
└── index.ts               # Updated to export auth module
```

### Key Authentication Types
- `AuthUser` - Extended user type with profile information
- `AuthSession` - Session state with tokens and user data
- `AuthError` - Standardized authentication error types
- `UserRole` - Role-based access control types

### Integration Points
- Supabase client initialization with environment configuration
- Database helper functions for user initialization
- RLS policy integration for data access control
- Mobile app authentication screens and state management

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: CS-P0-015 (Database helper functions) - **COMPLETED**
- **Prerequisite**: CS-P0-014 (RLS policies) - **COMPLETED**
- **Prerequisite**: CS-P0-013 (Database schema) - **COMPLETED**
- **Blocks**: CS-P1-001 (User registration flow)
- **Blocks**: CS-P1-002 (User login flow)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Shared package exports complete authentication module
- [x] Mobile app can register/login users with allowlist validation
- [x] User data is automatically initialized upon successful registration
- [x] RLS policies enforce proper data access based on authenticated user
- [x] All authentication flows are tested and working
- [x] Documentation updated with authentication setup instructions

## Implementation Summary
Successfully completed comprehensive Supabase authentication integration:

### Key Deliverables
1. **@clientsync/shared Package**: Created complete authentication module with TypeScript types, service layer, and utility functions
2. **Mobile App Integration**: Added AuthProvider context, authentication hooks, and protected route components  
3. **New Login Screens**: Implemented Supabase-powered login/register screens with form validation
4. **Security Features**: JWT token handling, secure storage via AsyncStorage, automatic token refresh
5. **Role-Based Access**: Full support for client/organizer/admin roles with permission utilities
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for authentication flows and validation

### Technical Achievements
- Seamless integration between Supabase authentication and existing Payload CMS architecture
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout the authentication stack
- Secure token management with automatic refresh
- Email allowlist validation during registration
- Automatic user profile creation with database initialization
- Compatible with existing RLS policies

### Files Created/Modified
- `packages/shared/`: Complete shared authentication package
- `packages/mobile-app/src/auth/`: AuthContext, hooks, ProtectedRoute
- `packages/mobile-app/src/app/login-supabase.tsx`: New Supabase login screen
- `packages/mobile-app/src/lib/supabase.ts`: Supabase client configuration
- `packages/mobile-app/src/tests/auth.test.ts`: Authentication test suite

Ready for Phase 1 authentication UI implementation and user flows.

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Authentication service methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Database integration with auth functions
3. **Manual Tests**: Complete registration and login flows
4. **Security Tests**: Verify RLS policies work with authenticated users

## Risk Mitigation
- **Token Security**: Implement secure token storage and rotation
- **Network Issues**: Add retry logic for authentication requests
- **Session Management**: Handle token expiration gracefully
- **Role Validation**: Ensure user roles are properly validated

## Implementation Notes
- Use Supabase Auth with custom claims for role-based access
- Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
- Add loading states for authentication operations
- Consider offline authentication state handling
- Follow security best practices for token management

## Post-Implementation
- Update mobile app screens to use authentication
- Implement protected routes and role-based navigation
- Add user profile management features
- Prepare for Phase 1 authentication UI implementation
