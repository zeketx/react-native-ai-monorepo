# CS-PC-003: Implement Authentication Strategy

## Priority
P1 - Core Feature

## Status
IN PROGRESS - Started 2025-07-05

## Description
Set up authentication flow using Payload CMS auth system, including email verification, allowlist functionality, and JWT token management for the React Native app.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Email/password authentication working
- [x] Email verification flow implemented
- [ ] Allowlist check before account creation
- [x] JWT tokens for mobile app authentication
- [x] Refresh token mechanism
- [x] Logout functionality
- [ ] Password reset flow

## Technical Details

### Auth Flow:
1. User enters email on mobile app
2. Check email against allowlist (custom endpoint)
3. If allowed, create user with verification token
4. Send verification email
5. User verifies email
6. User sets password
7. Issue JWT + refresh token
8. Store tokens securely in mobile app

### Implementation:
- Use Payload's auth-enabled Users collection
- Create custom allowlist endpoint
- Implement email verification hooks
- Configure JWT strategy for mobile
- Use secure storage for tokens (expo-secure-store)

## Dependencies
- CS-PC-002 (Collections must exist)
- Email service configuration (SendGrid/Resend)

## Progress Notes

### Phase 1: Authentication Foundation (COMPLETED)
- **Enhanced Users Collection** (`/packages/cms/src/collections/Users.ts`):
  - Added comprehensive email verification flow with custom HTML templates
  - Implemented user roles (super-admin, admin, organizer, premium-client, client)
  - Added profile fields (firstName, lastName, phone, profileImage, bio)
  - Created notification and privacy preferences
  - Added mobile-specific settings (device tokens, last login tracking)
  - Configured proper access controls and hooks
  - Set token expiration to 2 hours with account lockout after 5 failed attempts

- **Secure Token Storage** (`/packages/mobile-app/src/auth/storage.ts`):
  - Implemented SecureTokenStorage class using expo-secure-store
  - Added encryption with keychainService configuration
  - Created methods for storing/retrieving auth data, tokens, and user data
  - Added token validation with 5-minute buffer for refresh
  - Implemented secure token updates and cleanup functionality

- **Token Refresh Mechanism** (`/packages/mobile-app/src/auth/service.ts`):
  - Enhanced PayloadAuthService with automatic token refresh
  - Added makeAuthenticatedRequest() method with auto-refresh
  - Implemented secure storage integration for all auth operations
  - Added initializeFromStorage() for app startup auth restoration
  - Created isAuthenticated() method for auth state checking
  - Added comprehensive error handling and token cleanup

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Test complete registration → verification → login flow
- [ ] Verify token refresh mechanism works correctly
- [ ] Test secure storage persistence across app restarts
- [ ] Validate error handling for expired/invalid tokens

### Phase 3: Remaining Implementation
- [ ] Create allowlist check endpoint in Payload CMS
- [ ] Implement password reset flow
- [ ] Add rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] Create comprehensive error handling

## Files Modified/Created:
1. `/packages/cms/src/collections/Users.ts` - Enhanced with full auth configuration
2. `/packages/mobile-app/package.json` - Added expo-secure-store dependency
3. `/packages/mobile-app/src/auth/storage.ts` - New secure token storage service
4. `/packages/mobile-app/src/auth/service.ts` - Enhanced with token refresh and storage integration

## Next Steps:
1. Test authentication flow end-to-end
2. Create allowlist functionality
3. Implement password reset
4. Move to completion phase

## Estimated Effort
- Original: 4-6 hours
- Completed: ~3 hours (authentication foundation)
- Remaining: ~2 hours (testing + allowlist + password reset)
