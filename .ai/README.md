## Workflow Process

### Task Lifecycle
1. **Backlog** → **Doing** → **Done**
2. Tasks are defined in `.md` files with structured format
3. Each task has unique ID (e.g., CS-P0-016)
4. Tasks follow phase-based organization

### Phase Structure
- **Phase 0**: Foundation (Database, Auth, Core Infrastructure)
- **Phase 1**: Authentication & User Management
- **Phase 2**: Trip Planning & Booking
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Features & Integrations
- **Phase 4**: Performance & Optimization

### Task Management
- Use feature branches for each task or related task group
- Follow CLAUDE.md workflows for branch management
- Update task status in SDLC files when moving between phases
- Maintain clear acceptance criteria and implementation notes

## Current Status
- Phase 0 Foundation: Tasks CS-P0-001 through CS-P0-015 completed
- Database schema, RLS policies, and helper functions implemented
- Ready to proceed with next foundation tasks
