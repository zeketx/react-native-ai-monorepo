# ClientSync Travel Platform

## Overview

The **ClientSync Travel Platform** addresses the inefficiencies travel agencies face in managing high-value clientsâ€™ trip preferences, activities, and reservations. Current tools like generic CRMs, spreadsheets, and email threads are fragmented, error-prone, and lack client-facing interfaces, resulting in miscommunication and a subpar client experience. This platform offers a React Native mobile app for clients and a web-based dashboard for organizers, prioritizing simplicity, security, and scalability. This PRD outlines the requirements, features, and success metrics to ensure the development team delivers a solution that enhances client satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Introduction

### Project background

Travel agencies struggle with outdated tools that fail to meet the needs of high-value clients expecting premium, personalized service. These tools lack integration, real-time updates, and client-facing capabilities, leading to operational inefficiencies and reduced client satisfaction. The **ClientSync Travel Platform** provides a modern, secure, and mobile-first solution to streamline client onboarding and trip management.

### Objectives

- Enhance client satisfaction with a guided, tier-based onboarding experience.
- Improve operational efficiency by reducing manual coordination time by 50%.
- Ensure security and exclusivity through restricted access and GDPR/CCPA compliance.
- Deliver a scalable platform supporting 500 concurrent users with <1s response times.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Mobile app (React Native with Expo) for clients with email verification, onboarding, and itinerary viewing.
- Web dashboard (React with Vite) for organizers to manage clients and access.
- Secure cloud database (e.g., Supabase) with API hooks for future integrations.

**Out of Scope:**
- Direct booking within the app.
- Advanced analytics for organizers in the initial release.
